# Resume
This repository holds my current resume and links to my other content as well as explains a bit about myself.

## About me
I'm currently a junior dual Computer Science and Electronic Media, Arts, and Communications major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I'm particularly interested in work that lays in the intersection of art and technology. Iâ€™d love to be able to work on projects that people will directly interact with, be it on the web, desktop, or inside existing applications, whether that be as a full stack or app developer working on human interactive projects or as a technical director working on programs that allow artists to be artists by improving pipelines or creating tools. 

I am currently seeking a summer internship where I can work in a team and create a professional product.
